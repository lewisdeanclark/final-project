# European Football League Analysis

## Overview

This project analyses the top 5 European football leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1) to explore team and league performance, playing style, and efficiency using match-level data. The goal is to uncover data-driven league identities rather than relying on opinions.

## Why League Identity Matters

Explains why some teams succeed or struggle in different environments.

Informs scouting and management decisions.

Helps fans and analysts understand league-specific playing styles.

## Data

Source: FBRef (public match stats).

Scope: 25 tables covering team stats (goals, possession, shots, cards) across multiple seasons.

Cleaning: Standardised column names, checked for missing values and outliers, added League_ID and Season for consistency.

## Key Analyses

### Possession:

Average across leagues is similar (~48–49%), but the Premier League shows high variation between teams.

### Attacking Metrics:

Bundesliga = highest goals per 90, efficient but unpredictable.

La Liga = slower, possession-focused, lower scoring.

### Transitions:

Premier League → dribble-heavy, dynamic.

Ligue 1 → pass-heavy, structured progression.

Bundesliga → structured, minimal dribbling.

### Physicality:

La Liga has the highest card-based intensity; the Premier League has the lowest.

### Correlations:

More possession does not always lead to more goals.

Progressive passing correlates moderately with expected goals (xG).

## Key Takeaways

Bundesliga: direct, high-scoring, volatile.

Premier League: progressive, variable team styles.

La Liga: slow, controlled, possession-oriented.

Serie A: balanced, calculated attacking.

Ligue 1: strong progression, moderate scoring.

Physicality and discipline vary across leagues, influenced by refereeing and cultural context.
